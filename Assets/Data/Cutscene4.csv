,,Scene 4
ProfessorAurea,Happy,"Magnificent timing, you two! I was just about to take this thing for a test run myself. I wasn’t sure if you were coming in today since someone(glances at Cynthi)took forever to get you…"
ProfessorAurea,Happy,"Nevertheless!!! That prosthetic you sent up was a real piece of work, I stayed up all night taking a look at it… of course, I couldn’t help making a few tweaks here and there… but this truly is your piece-de-resistance!! Just what I expect from my boy…"
ProfessorAurea,Happy,"Of course, I picked out the color myself. So— don’t be shy, it’s all yours! Try it on, wave it around, and tell me what you think! "
Cynthi,shock,Alonso are you okay?! 
Alonso,neutral,"(weakly) (looking down) Y-yeah...I’m fine. (confidently)(raises head) I’m alright."
ProfessorAurea,Neutral,Hold on. Let him learn.
Cynthi,shock,So? How do you feel?! 
Alonso,Neutral,… Stronger
Cynthi,shock,Stronger?
Alonso,neutral/shock,"I can feel it Cynthi...every groove, every cable, every pulse of energy oscillating running through this hand. (pause) But it’s not mine."
Alonso,sad,It’s not my strength.
Cynthi,angry,"Not yours…? This is your machine, your arm, and the product of all your hard work, how can you say it isn’t yours?! "
Alonso,sad,I just— 
Cynthi,neutral,Stop.
Cynthi,neutral,"Some feelings...just can’t be expressed with words alone, ain’t that right Alonso?"
Alonso,neutral ,Without words…? What are you—
Cynthi,happy,"Enough talking! Let’s see you grit those teeth! "
Cynthi,neutral,(panting) Do you get it now?
Alonso,neutral,How about we try that one more ti—
ProfessorAurea,Happy,"Children! While I appreciate the enthusiasm, and I’d love nothing more than to observe what this apparatus can really do… duty calls! And without someone around to make sure you two don’t break something, I’d kindly ask that you keep the fighting away from these marvelously polished institute doors for now."
ProfessorAurea,Happy,"Scurry on now you two— and as always my dear boy, c’est magnifique! Ta ta!! "
Cynthi,neutral,"So listen...I’ve gotta head out and finish my work with Professor Avrati up in the greenhouse, I’m guessing you’re gonna go finish up back out by your house right?"
Cynthi,neutral,"Well, I’ll catch up with you later then, right? "
Cynthi,neutral,"By the way...that arm of yours? Thing packs one hell of a punch. Take care, bozo. "
