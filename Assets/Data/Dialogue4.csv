,,Scene 4
ACTION,Narrator,The doors creak open and Professor Aurea pops out, holding a metal box. 
Prof. Aurea,happy,Magnificent timing, you two!
Prof. Aurea,happy,I was just about to take this thing for a test run myself.
Prof. Aurea,happy,I wasn’t sure if you were coming in today since someone...
Prof. Aurea,neutral,*glances at Cynthi* took forever to get you ...
Prof. Aurea,happy,Nevertheless!!! 
Prof. Aurea,happy,That prosthetic you have was a real piece of work.
Prof. Aurea,happy,I stayed up all night experimenting with new components ...
Prof. Aurea,happy,of course, I couldn’t help making a few tweaks here and there… 
Prof. Aurea,happy,but this truly is your piece-de-resistance!! 
Prof. Aurea,happy,Just what I expect from my boy...
ACTION,Narrator,Alonso quickly runs up the stairs and opens the box.
ACTION,Narrator,He pulls out a small chip and inserts it into his metal hand's wrist.
Prof. Aurea,happy,Of course, I picked out the color myself. So — 
Prof. Aurea,happy,don’t be shy, it’s all yours! Try it on, wave it around, and tell me what you think!
ACTION,Narrator,Its smooth exterior glistens a golden hue in the sunlight, while blue circuits pulse within its thin grooves. 
ACTION,Narrator,Alonso pulls back his cloak and activates the metallic arm.
ACTION,Narrator,He winces and drops to his knees, as waves of electricity surge outwards from the arm through his body.
Cynthi,shock,Alonso are you okay?! 
Alonso,shock,... Y-yeah...
Alonso,neutral,I’m alright.
ACTION,Narrator,Cynthi reaches for him. 
Prof. Aurea,neutral,Hold on. Let him learn.
ACTION,Narrator,Alonso breathes heavily as he rises.
ACTION,Narrator,The arm’s glow settles as its circuits light up. 
Cynthi,shock,So? How do you feel?! 
Alonso,neutral,...Stronger
Cynthi,shock,Stronger?
Alonso,shock,I can feel it Cynthi...
Alonso,shock,every groove, every cable, every pulse of energy oscillating running through my arm...
Alonso,neutral,...
Alonso,sad,But it’s not mine.
ACTION,Narrator,Alonso somberly pulls a seed from his pouch, admiring it.
ACTION,Narrator,*CRACK*
ACTION,Narrator,The seed crumbles to dust and flies away with the wind. Alonso lowers his head.
Alonso,sad,It’s not my strength.
Cynthi,angry,Not yours…? 
Cynthi,angry,This is your machine, your arm, and the product of all your hard work ...
Cynthi,angry,How can you say it isn’t yours?!
Alonso,sad,I just— 
Cynthi,neutral,Stop.
ACTION,Narrator,Cynthis paces back and forth, walking past Alonso and Professor Aurea.
Cynthi,neutral,Some feelings...
ACTION,Narrator,Cynthi walk back and stops in front of Alonso.
Cynthi,neutral,just can’t be expressed with words alone, ain’t that right Alonso?
Alonso,neutral,Without words...?
Alonso,neutral,What are you—
Cynthi,happy,Enough talking! Let’s see you grit those teeth!
