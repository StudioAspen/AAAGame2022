Alonso,neutral,the sun’s only been out for a few minutes, aren’t you supposed to be busy crowing to wake everyone up? Maybe circling over some carrion?

Cynthi,happy,OOPS!!! I almost forgot!! I caught up with your mom by the greenhouse; she said she finished taking a look at your invention! She’s probably waiting for us back at the institute so let’s get moving.
