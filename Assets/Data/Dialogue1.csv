ACTION,Narrator,Alonso turns to see where the noise is coming from. 
Alonso,neutral,Cynthi... 
Alonso,neutral,the sun’s only been out for a few minutes. Aren’t you supposed to be busy crowing to wake everyone up?
Alonso,neutral,Maybe circling over some carrion?
ACTION,Narrator,Alonso snickers, cracking a weak smile.
ACTION,Narrator,Cynthi walks closer and grabs Alonso's shoulder
Cynthi,neutral,Ha Ha. Hilarious, doofus. 
Cynthi,neutral,Maybe spend a little less time thinking about birds and a little more time digging the wax outta those ...

Cynthi,neutral,*points at the ground*
Cynthi,neutral,This soil is putrid, the dew point around here is constantly fluctuating

Cynthi,happy,See! There’s the dummy I know—
ACTION,Narrator,Cynthi pulls Alonso close and hugs him while smiling sinisterly.
Cynthi,neutral,Now get those seeds outta the ground before I plant your face in the dirt right next to 'em...

Cynthi,neutral,Cynthi thinks for a moment ...
Cynthi,happy,...
Cynthi,happy,OH!!! I almost forgot!!
Cynthi,happy,I caught up with your mom by the greenhouse.
Cynthi,happy,She said she finished taking a look at your invention! 
Cynthi,happy,She’s probably waiting for us back at the institute so let’s get moving.
